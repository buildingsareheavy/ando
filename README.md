> [Tadao Ando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Ando) is a a Japanese self-taught architect whose style emphasizing nothingness and empty space to represent the beauty of simplicity.

Ando can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
git clone git@github.com/buildingsareheavy/ando.git && cd ando
```

Review the script (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```sh
less blueprints
```

blueprints:

```sh
cd ando

// Basic Setup
sh goAndo

// Login Setup
sh goAndo 2>&1 | tee ~/ando.log
```

Just follow the prompts and youâ€™ll be fine. ðŸ‘Œ

:warning: Warning: I advise against running [this script](goAndo) unless you understand what itâ€™s doing to your computer.

I created this based on my own preferences; your mileage may vary.

Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.

It is highly recommended to run the script regularly to keep your computer up to date.

Your last `sh goAndo` run will be saved to `~/ando.log`. To review it, run `less ~/ando.log`.

That's it!
